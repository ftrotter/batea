Steps to setup new instance of Patch

* You will probably need to turn off selinux in order to allow apache to write to disk. 
   Or you can figure out how to configure selinux to permit that...
* chown apache:apache tmp -R
* chown apache:apache app/storage -R
* cp app/config_template app/config -R
* create a patch user and give it the ability to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on all db tables...
* edit app/config/database.php with mysql information
* edit app/config/session.php with website
* make sure app/config/mail.php has correct email information
* The version 1 data sources will not work until config.yaml is corrected in the main directory
